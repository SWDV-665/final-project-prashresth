        FAQs:
      </h1>
      <div class="faq">
        <b>
          How long will my dog's groom take?
        </b>

        <p>
        You can generally plan for your dog's visit to be approximately three hours in length from drop-off to pick-up.
        </p>

        <b>What is your cancellation policy?</b>
        <p>
          If you must cancel, a 24 hour notice is requested so the appointment set aside for you may be open for another's use.
        </p>

        <b>What products are used to groom my dog? What if my dog has sensitive skin?</b>
        <p>
          We use high-quality, all-natural products.
          We also offer organic products that are great for sensitive skin and will make your dog's coat soft and shiny.
        </p>

        <b>At what age should I bring my puppy in to be groomed?</b>
        <p>
          Puppies may be introduced to professional grooming at about 3 months of age. In this way, a puppy can begin
          its life with the understanding that grooming is a common and good experience.
        </p>

        <b>How often should my dog be groomed?</b>
        <p>
          It depends upon your dog's coat, its breed and how much brushing and detangling you normally do at home.
          In general, every 6-8 weeks will keep your pet looking his best.  And when company comes!
        </p>

        <b>How important is nail trimming?</b>
        <p>
          Nail trimming is essential for maintaining good health. If trimming is not done consistently (every month or two),
          walking can become increasingly difficult or painful. The "quick" will grow along with the nail so cutting nails to a proper length will take many trimmings before the nails can be as short as they should be.  We offer nail trim-only appointments for your convenience.
