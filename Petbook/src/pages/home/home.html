                When it comes to your dog’s care, there are lots of choices.
                What Happy Paws provides is a detailed, personalized and loving environment for your social pup.
                We hope to be more than just a Dog Daycare. We want to be who you call for training advice,
                where your dog pulls you to the door, and a place you can rely on.
                Your dog needs time to be a dog, and here at Happy Paws they can sniff, play and get a good belly rub
                while moms and dads are busy. Happy Paws welcomes you to come check us out.
