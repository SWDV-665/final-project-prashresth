          When you arrive at Happy Paws our stylists put your pet first.
          We make sure we get to know your pet, understand any special needs they may have,
          and consult with you on the services and style you would like.
          We provide a quieter and less chaotic environment to ensure your pet is comfortable and
          less stressed during their grooming experience.
